# Tree-Leaf-Species-Classifier
This project is a Machine Learning classification system that predicts the species of a tree based on its leaf measurements. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is trained using:  Leaf length (cm)  Leaf width (cm)  Color intensity score  The trained model is saved using Pickle and deployed using a Streamlit web application.
